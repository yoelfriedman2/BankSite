# To-dos

Running list of things to review and decide. (Feature ideas live in IDEAS.md — this is for open work items.)

## Live: FDIC sync tool

Owner-only page at `/admin/fdic` (linked from Admin → Users). Manual "Check against FDIC"
button — nothing runs on a schedule, nothing writes until you click Accept on a specific item.
Five sections: Closed or merged (informational only, banks are NEVER auto-deleted), Name
changes, Websites (re-verifies the URL loads at the moment you accept it), Assets (per-row or
"Accept all"), City/state. Accepted changes propagate to every user's copy of that bank by cert,
same as any other shared field. Private fields (status, priority, notes, target balance) are
never touched.

## Decide: which FDIC fields should sync on a schedule (still open)

The sync tool above is manual-only today. Revisit whether any category should run automatically
(e.g. assets quarterly) vs. stay propose-and-review forever — the owner was clear not everything
should auto-update, since some app data is deliberately different from FDIC's.

## Review: 21 banks that no longer exist (from FDIC check, 2026-07-03)

The FDIC says these are no longer insured institutions — merged, acquired, converted, or closed.
**Not deleted from the app** — review each: find where it went (successor bank? did it convert — was there a payout event we missed?), then remove or retag.

## Minor FDIC name differences (left alone as cosmetic)

Real rebrands were applied in the app as "New Name (formerly Old Name)". These five were only
legal-suffix or spelling tweaks, so the app names were left unchanged — fix manually if you care:

- 20741 Pioneer Bank → "Pioneer Bank, National Association"
- 29496 Seneca Savings → "Seneca Savings Bank, National Association"
- 29535 De Witt Savings Bank → "DeWitt Savings Bank" (spacing)
- 29571 The Home Savings and Loan Company of Kenton, Ohio → same, "DBA HSLC"
- 29676 Paper City Savings Association → "Paper City Savings Bank, S.A."

## Websites not loaded into the app (failed the live check)

FDIC has a website on file for these 11, but it didn't respond when checked on 2026-07-03
(some may just block bots). Verify by hand and add via the bank editor if real:
